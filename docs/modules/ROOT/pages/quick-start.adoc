// TODO split up in three different parts? Bootstrapping DFM / Desinging a document / Creating documents

This document provides a quick introduction to using Dynamic Documents in your application.

What we'll do:

* [*] Create a simple application with DynamicFormsModule
* [*] Design a new document type and put it in a dataset
* [*] Create a document instance of that type, using the built-in admin UI

== Create a new web application

To create an application with the use of `DynamicFormsModule`, generate an across application through the link:{ax-initializr-url}[Across Initializr].
In the following sections, we'll be using an application generated with xref:across:releases:platform/2.1.1.adoc[Across 2.1.1.RELEASE] and the following modules:

- `AcrossWebModule`
- `AdminWebModule`
- `AcrossHibernateJpaModule`
- `UserModule`
- `EntityModule`

== Add the DynamicFormsModule

Now that we have a sample application, we still need to add DynamicFormsModule.
This is done by adding the dependency for the module and specifying it in the application descriptor.

.Add the maven dependency
[source,xml, indent=0]
----
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.foreach.across.modules</groupId>
     <artifactId>dynamic-forms-module</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.Bootstrap the module when starting the application
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@AcrossApplication(
		modules = {
				AcrossWebModule.NAME,
				AdminWebModule.NAME,
				AcrossHibernateJpaModule.NAME,
				UserModule.NAME,
				EntityModule.NAME,
				DynamicFormsModule.NAME # <1>
		}
)
public class DemoApplication
{
	public static void main( String[] args ) {
		SpringApplication.run( DemoApplication.class, args );
	}
}
----
<1> Add `DynamicFormsModule` to the bootstrapped modules.

If we'd now start up the application, we can see that `DynamicFormsModule` is bootstrapped.

.Abbreviated start-up log
----

...

== Designing our document

Now that the module is present in the application, we can start using it's functionality.
The core of the module is the creation of dynamic documents, e.g. storing content in a dynamically configurable structure.

Before we can store content, we need to create the structure for storing that data, which is done by creating a definition.
Different types of definitions exist for a different purpose.
Currently, two types are used:

- `document`: documents definitions hold the structures of our document content.
Using these definitions, groups of fields can be declared to store data.
- `view`: `DynamicFormsModule` integrates with `EntityModule` through which various views can be defined to render data.
View definitions allow these views to be modified, for example which properties should be rendered.

=== Create a dataset

The first step to create a document, is to create a dataset.
Datasets are logical groups of definitions, for example a dataset `Job application` could hold definitions for job, applicants, job titles...

Let's start off by creating a data set.
To do so, we'll navigate to the menu item `Data sets & definitions`.
There we can create a new data set with a specific name and key, for example:

----
name: Job application
key: job-application
----

image::creating-a-dataset.png[Creating a dataset]

=== Create the document definition

Definitions can define various structures, such as the content structure for a document and the configuration of a view.
In this example, we'll be creating a `document` for an Applicant, to define which information we would like to store.

To create a definition, we navigate to the tab `Definitions` on a dataset, where we can start creating new definitions.
Before we can define the structure for the `Applicant` documents, we must create a definition of the correct type:

----
name: Applicant
key: applicant
type: document # <1>
----
<1> We create a definition of the type `document` which allows us to define the document structure as a combination of various fields.

image::creating-a-definition.png[Creating a definition]

Now, we can further modify the definition and add fields to store information.

For each applicant, we'd like to store the following information:

- The applicant's date of birth
- The address of the applicant; being a combination of the street (name + house number), zipcode and city.
- Expected monthly salary (in EUR)
- The applicant's motivation

When we transform this into a definition, we end up with the following structure:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
document-definition: # <1>
  name: Applicant
  content: # <2>
  - id: date-of-birth # <3>
    type: date # <4>
  - id: address
    type: fieldset # <4>
    fields:
    - id: street
      type: string
    - id: zip-code
      type: number
    - id: city
      type: string
  - id: expected-salary
    type: currency(EUR) #<4>
  - id: motivation
    type: text
----
<1> Definitions always have a root element.
In this case, we're creating the structure for a document, for which the root element is `document-definition`.
<2> A definition has fields which will make up the structure of the document.
 These are defined in the `content` element of the definition.
<3> Every field has an `id` which makes up the key under which the information will be stored.
The key for a field is a combination of the ids of field itself and its parents, with fields under the `content` element as root items.
In this definition, the following are examples of full keys: `date-of-birth`, `address.zip-code` and `expected-salary`.
<4> Various types of fields are used to represent data.

[NOTE]
====
In the above image, we can also notice the `published` and `current/new version` fields.
Modifying a definition by using the default UI will always result in a new version with the applied modifications:

- published modifications: The modifications are gathered in a fixed version.
Documents that are updated or created will be using the most recently published version.
- non-published modifications: A draft version is created and further non-published modifications will modify the draft version.
====

== Add a document

Now that a definition is present, a menu item for our definition is automatically generated through which we can create documents for that definition.
Every document for the aforementioned definition will have the structure we've defined, so, let's create a document with the following information:

----
Name: Nancy Thompson
Date of birth: 1971/12/28
Street: Elm Street, 1428
Zip code: 8972
City: SpringWood
Expected salary: 2134
----

image::creating-a-document.png[Creating an applicant]

Depending on the fields we've defined in the `Applicant` definition, various fields were generated based on their field type e.g. a date control, a fieldset (to group other fields), a currency control...
The order in which they are defined, is also kept during the rendering process.
If you would reorder the fields in the definition, the new order would be applied to the document as well.

Aside of the rendering of fields, basic validation is applied as well, should you for example, attempt to submit plain text in the `zip-code` control or not fill in the name of the document, validation errors will occur.

image::basic-validation.png[Example of basic validation]

NOTE: One of the fields on the document was not defined in the definition structure.
This is the field `Name`, which will be the `name` of the document itself.

== Create a new document version

Documents are also xref:working-with-documents/document-versions.adoc[versioned].
As soon as we had created our document, a `History` tab appeared.
The history tab provides a list of all document versions of a single document.

To illustrate a new version being created, let's modify the expected salary from `€ 2134` to `€ 3140`.
By updating the content of the document, a new version will be created with the original data and our changes.

Upon navigating to the history tab, two versions will be available, of which the details can be viewed by clicking on the eye-icon.

The above are the basics of how to work with definitions and documents.
