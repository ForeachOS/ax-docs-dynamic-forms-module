= Getting started

This document provides a quick introduction to using Dynamic Documents in your application.

What we'll do:

* [*] Create a simple application with DynamicFormsModule
* [*] Design a new document type and put it in a dataset
* [*] Create a document instance of that type, using the built-in admin UI

== Create a new web application

//goto initializr, create a web application with adminweb, usermodule, entitymodule

== Add the DynamicFormsModule

//add the dependency
//add the module name
//start application

== Designing our document

//explain that we we will create a new definition

=== Create a dataset
//goto dataset, create a new dataset name
//explain what a dataset is

=== Create the document definition

// add document definition
// add a simple document with some field types & a field set
// save the definition

== Add a document

// go to document, create a new document
// fill-in the document, notice form layout - mention basic validation being applied
// after saving, the general tab shows readonly data of the document
// we can also see version 1 being mentioned

== Create a new document version

// go to history tab, see there is one clickable entry, the current version
// back to general, update document
// we have existing data loaded, if we update
// new version gets created
// history shows both versions and allows us to view them

== What's next?

// more on building a document definition
// link to field types
