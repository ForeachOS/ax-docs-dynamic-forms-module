= Dynamic field validators

The following field validators are available by default:

== Required field

Validator that checks that a field value has been entered:

* the value should not be `null`
* the value should not be empty ("") if the field type is a `String`
* the value should not be empty (length 0) if the field type is a `Collection` or `Array`

Adding a required field validator can be done with a single key value.
