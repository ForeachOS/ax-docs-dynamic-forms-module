= Creating a custom type definition

It is possible to create a custom type definition inside your your YAML file. The scope of the type definition is limited to the current document definition.

The types defined in a custom type definition can be reused several times throughout the document definition.

A custom type definition is defined by using the `types` field and specifying the `base-type` for each field.

The following example creates a `street` type, which can be reused:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: person
  types:
    - id: street
      base-type: string
    - id: address
      base-type: fieldset
      fields:
        - id: street-name
          type: street
        - id: street-nr
          type: number
        - id: zipcode
          type: number
  content:
    - id: firstname
      type: string
    - id: lastname
      type: string
    - id: home-address
      type: address
    - id: work-address
      type: address
