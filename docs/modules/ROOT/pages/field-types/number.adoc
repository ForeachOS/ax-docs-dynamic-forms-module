= `number` field type

The `number` type in a document definition will render an `input field`. It will be mapped to the Java Type `java.util.Long`.

The type definition is built by the `SimpleDynamicTypeDefinitionBuilder`.

The following example is a minimalistic representation of a user with a certain age:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: person
  content:
    - id: name
      type: string
    - id: age
      type: number
----

It is also possible to supply several accepted values for a `number`, with a descriptive label. This will render a dropdown with the values of the `possible-values` field:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: first-five-fibonnaci-numbers
  content:
    - id: fibonnaci
      type: number
      possible-values:
        - 1: 'number 1'
        - 2: '1+1'
        - 3: '1+2'
        - 5: '2+3'
        - 8: '3+5'
----

You can also use a `number[]` which will create a checkbox group for the list of `possible-values`:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: participant
  content:
    - id: name
      type: string
    - id: olympic-year-locations
      type: number[]
      possible-values:
        - 2014: 'Sochi (2014)'
        - 2016: 'Rio De Janeiro (2016)'
        - 2018: 'Pyeongchang (2018)'
        - 2020: 'Tokyo (2020)'
        - 2022: 'Beijing (2022)'
        - 2024: 'Paris (2024)'
