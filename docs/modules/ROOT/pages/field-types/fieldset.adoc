= Fieldset field types

A fieldset is a collection of other fields, stored as a `DynamicDataFieldSet` map.
It is usually visualized as a `fieldset` in HTML, with the member fields inside it.

When working with fieldsets the different member fields are usually accessed and set directly.
The path to a member field of a fieldset will always start with the path of the fieldset it belongs to.

A `fieldset` field requires additional field definitions to be registered under the `fields` key.
