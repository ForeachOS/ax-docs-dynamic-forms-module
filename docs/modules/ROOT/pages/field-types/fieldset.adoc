= `fieldset` field type

The `fieldset` type in a document definition represents a collection of fields. It accepts a `field` property, which can be used to group the fields inside an HTML `fieldset` tag.

The type definition is built by the `FieldsetDynamicTypeDefinitionBuilder`.

The following example is a representation of a company:

        - id: operational
          type: boolean
        - id: shareholders
          type: string
          possible-values:
