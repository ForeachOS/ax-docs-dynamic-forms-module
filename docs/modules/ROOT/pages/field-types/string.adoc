= `string` and `text` field type

The `string` type in a document definition will render an `input` field. It will be mapped to the Java Type `java.lang.String`.

The `text` field in a document definition will render a `textarea`.  It will be mapped to the Java Type `java.lang.String`.

The type definition is built by the `SimpleDynamicTypeDefinitionBuilder`.

The following example is a representation of a user with a description of his hobbies:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: person
  content:
    - id: firstname
      type: string
    - id: lastname
      type: string
    - id: hobbies
      type: text
----

It is also possible to supply several accepted values for a `string` this will render a dropdown the values of the `possible-values` field:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: company
  content:
    - id: activities
      type: string
      possible-values:
        - building-software
        - selling-cars
        - destroying-houses
----

You can also use a `string[]` which will create a checkbox group for the list of `possible-values`:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: company
  content:
    - id: activities
      type: string[]
      possible-values:
        - building-software
        - selling-cars
        - destroying-houses
