= Linked entities

You can refer to another entity by prefixing it with the *@* symbol in the `type` field.

The type definition is built by the `EntityDynamicTypeDefinitionBuilder`.
It will lookup the entity by removing the @ and looking up the name in the `EntityRegistry`.

The following example uses the xref:user-module::index.adoc[UserModule] to generate a `manager` dropdown with a list of users known in its xref:user-module::index.adoc#_user_directories[User Directory]:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: employee
  content:
    - id: firstname
      type: string
    - id: lastname
      type: string
    - id: manager
      type: '@user'
----

You can also use a `@user[]` which will create a checkbox group for the entity with the name `user`:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: employee
  content:
    - id: firstname
      type: string
    - id: lastname
      type: string
    - id: managers
      type: '@user[]'
