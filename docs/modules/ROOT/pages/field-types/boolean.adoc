= `boolean` field type

The `boolean` type in a document definition will render a checkbox. It will be mapped to the Java Type `java.util.Boolean`.

The type definition is built by the `SimpleDynamicTypeDefinitionBuilder`.

The following example is a minimalistic representation of an active user:

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: person
  content:
    - id: name
      type: string
    - id: active
      type: boolean
