= Linked documents

A linked document field is a field referencing another document or documentVersion.
A linked document field is defined by specifying the document id as type.

== Single value field
We're creating a definition to save job applications, however the data from the application is saved separately, e.g. a reference to the job application, but also the applicants information.
The following `applicant` definition will reference existing vacancy within the dataset `jobs` as well as the applicant, which is saved as a user document in dataset `hr`.

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: applicant
  content:
    - id: applicant
      type: 'document(hr:user)' # <1>
    - id: vacancy
      type: 'document(jobs:vacancy@2)' # <2>
----
<1> Reference to a document which uses a definition with full key `hr:user`.
<2> Reference to a document which uses version 2 of the definition with full key `jobs:vacancy`.

NOTE: It is advised to wrap the `type` specifier in single or double quotes to ensure it is treated as a string and to avoid parsing errors.

The above example can also be written with the `options-query` attribute, as shown below.
The query in the attribute should be an xref:entity-module::entity-query/eql.adoc#entity-query-language-eql[EQL] statement.

[source,yaml]
----
document-definition:
  name: applicant
  content:
    - id: applicant
      type: 'document'
      attributes:
         options-query: "type.key = 'user' and type.dataSet.key = 'hr'" # <1>
    - id: vacancy
      type: 'document'
      attributes:
         options-query: "type.key = 'vacancy' and type.dataSet.key = 'jobs' and type.latestVersion.version = 2" # <2>
----
<1> The equivalent of `type: 'document(hr:user)'`
<2> The equivalent of `type: 'document(jobs:vacancy@2)'`

|===
|Type specifier |Description

| `document`
| References a `DynamicDocument` entity.
 The type specification is equal to `@dynamicDocument`.

| `document(hr:user)`
| References a `DynamicDocument` for a definition `user` in the `hr` dataset.

| `document(hr:user/address)`
| References a `DynamicDocument` for a definition `address` which has the `user` definition as its parent in the `hr` dataset.

| `document(hr:user@2)`
| References a `DynamicDocument` for a definition `user` with version `2` in the `hr` dataset.

NOTE: In the table above `documentVersion` can be used instead of `document` as well to reference documents that use a specific definition version, e.g. `documentVersion(hr:user@2)`
